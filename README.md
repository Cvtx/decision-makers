[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Cvtx/decision-makers/)

A Game Against Nature is a 1-player game, in which a single rational self-interested player must choose a strategy, and the outcome and the player’s payoff depends on both his chosen strategy and the “choice” made by a totally disinterested nature. Nature's practical role is to act as a random number generator.

Implemented criteria:
* Wald's maximin criterion
* Savage criterion
* Hurwicz criterion
* Hodges–Lehmann criterion
* Maximum Expected Utility criterion
* Minimum Expected Risk criterion
* and more
